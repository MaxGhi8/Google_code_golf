I **strongly reccomend to use the tigrotto's notebook on Kaggle** to optimize the variable names. All is automated even there but for some case makes some errors (I still not know why LOL).
Task for compression del tigrotto: 118, 133, 157, 158, 173, 233, 361, 366, 392
Task that are **heavy** to loops for minimizing the variables name but that have been **optimized**: 101, 209
Task that are **heavy** to loops for minimizing the variables name: 89, 93, 110, 145, 205, 378, 379
Here I got some errors when running the optimization name variables routine, I do not know why: 219
