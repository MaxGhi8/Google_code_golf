description: Shorten a solution for a Google Code Golf task.
---
We’re competing in the Google Code Golf challenge.  
There are 400 tasks: each has an input image (matrix) and an output image (matrix), and the goal is to discover the transformation pattern and implement it as a function.  
The aim is to write the shortest possible function.

I’ll show you the function I’ve written for solving one of the tasks.  
Your job is to rewrite the function with the same logic but in the fewest characters possible (minimize bytes).  
Only the Python standard library is allowed.  

You have access to [Code Tips](../../code_tips.md) for golfing strategies, and [Code Checker](../../code_golf_utils.py) for checking correctness.  

Let’s make `${fileBasename}` as shortest as possible.
