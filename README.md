# Google Code Golf Challenge - Progress Tracker

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains solutions for 401 Google Code Golf tasks, numbered from `task000.py` to `task400.py`. Each task focuses on writing the shortest possible Python code to solve specific problems.

## 🏆 Goals

- ✅ Complete all 400 tasks
- 🎯 Optimize for minimal character count
- 🕒 Execution time does not count, 😈 only bytes matters here

## 🚀 Getting Started

The challenge description is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-code-golf-2025/overview) and the notebook to starts with is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mmoffitt/neurips-2025-google-code-golf-championship) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jazivxt/oh-barnacles) there is a notebook with already many solutions available, but probably not optimal.

### Useful Links from Kaggle of this particular competition
- [All problem solved](https://www.kaggle.com/code/antonoof/manual-modification-golf) start from tigrotto and additionally golfed from someone else.

- [9 Hard problems tigrotto](https://www.kaggle.com/code/garrymoss/golfed-solutions-and-explanations-to-hard-problems) 9 of the hardest problem solved and explained by trigrotto.
- [Regex](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-code-golf-2025/discussion/608989#3293828) regex can be used in some problems (but we do not still now how ahah).
- [Flateview](https://lynn.github.io/flateview/) tool to visualize how well your code compresses, remember to add 60 bytes for the decompression stuffs.
